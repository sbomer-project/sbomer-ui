# Running UI Container file for dev purposes

To run the application locally, you can use Docker Compose. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `hack/local-dev`directory (if not already there).

2. Start the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. UI image is run and basic nginx config is attached, all defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
4. Access the UI at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
## Note
- This setup is mainly used for testing UI Containerfile related issues and changes.

- For classic UI development, running `./hack/run-local-ui.sh` from the root directory is recommended.

# Running UI alongside other SBOMer NextGen Components (deploying them all to local minikube)

## Getting Started (Development)

### 1. Start the Infrastructure

Run the local dev setup script from the root of the project repository to set up the minikube environment:

```shell script
bash ./hack/setup-local-dev.sh
```

Then run the command below to start the podman-compose with the component build:

```bash
bash ./hack/run-compose-with-local-build.sh
```

This will spin up the manifest-storage-service on port 8085 along with the latest Quay images of the other components of the system.
